- [**Building an Agentic Scientific Research Team with Google's Agent Development Kit**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/building-an-agentic-scientific-research) – Build a multi-agent research team using Google's Agent Development Kit to automate literature review and methodology extraction.

### Posts

- [**M-PACE: Multimodal GenAI Compliance**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/dbd) – Evaluate multimodal LLM compliance for vision and text capabilities, balancing accuracy, cost, and latency.
- [**Teaching GenAI to think before speaking**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/8d9) – Safety-aware chain-of-thought and Monte Carlo Tree Search help LLMs reason through multiple paths before responding.
- [**Jagged Frontier – Part 3: Blind Trust at the Edge**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/jagged-frontier-part-3-blind-trust) – How direct LLM output copying ("retainment") signals success within the jagged frontier but leads to errors outside it.
- [**Jagged Frontier – Part 2**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/645) – Introduction to Centaur and Cyborg collaboration styles—distinct vs. blended human-AI teamwork patterns.
- [**Jagged Frontier - part 1**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/jagged-frontier-part-1) – The jagged frontier concept: the unpredictable boundary between what AI handles well and poorly.
- [**Author-affiliations: A Python Tool for NSF Proposal Writers**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/author-affiliations-a-python-tool) – Automate NSF COA document creation by pulling author and affiliation metadata from Crossref and OpenAlex.
- [**AI and Academic Writing: Ethical Integrity**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/95c) – Propose including AI prompt logs in academic publishing to support ethical transparency and reduce language barriers.
- [**AI and Accessibility in Academia: A Step Toward Inclusion**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/360) – GenAI technologies like LLMs and vectorization reduce barriers for disabled and non-native English-speaking researchers.
- [**AI and Mitigating Bias in Academia**](https://ericabelson.substack.com/p/554) – How GenAI both introduces and mitigates bias in academic writing, with focus on responsible tool use.
