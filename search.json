Abelson, *A. Kazanjian, D.T. Blumstein. Canid vs. canid: insights into coyote-dog encounters from social media.  Human Wildlife Interactions. (2018) 12(2), 9\n\n\nSmall mammal genetic isolation and the role of connectivity structures: Assessing landscape-level features that increase connectivity for wildlife is difficult - this is complicated by that it can be difficult to know exactly which landscape features wildlife are using as movement corridors.  I am using genetic tools, large highways with variation in connectivity, and small mammal taxa (where small home-range size limits access to the range of connectivity variation) to address this question.    \n\nCorrelates of mammalian species endangerment: Preserving biological diversity in mammalian fauna is made more difficult by the complexity of behaviors that influence their ability to thrive in changing landscapes.  The brain is the seat of information processing, storage and the origination of most behaviors yet the implications of brain measurements have not been explored in conservation biology.  I explored the implications of increased relative encephalization (RE; brain size corrected for body size and phylogeny) and have found a relationship between this rapidly measurable and extinction vulnerability both in modern taxa as well as in Carnivores over the prior 40 million years.  Related manuscripts:\n\nAbelson, E.S.
